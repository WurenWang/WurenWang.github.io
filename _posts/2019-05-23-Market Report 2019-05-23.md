## News 

### 1.Oil hit with year's biggest drop

WTI crude settled back below $60/barrel for the first time since March, with oil now on track for largest weekly drop of 2019. Added to notable decline yesterday following unexpected US crude inventory build, it may due to the trade war because Chinese have stopped buying oil and gas from USA and started taking in Russian cargoes instead. But remember what happened last fall. Oil got crushed and then came back. And the effect of the trade war can be vanished as time whens by, so It can be a good opportunity to be a buying Position.
